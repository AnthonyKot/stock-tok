## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: UX Improvements

#### 1. Responsive Design Implementation (1 day, 0 ACU)
- Update Angular component CSS with media queries
- Implement Bootstrap or Flexbox-based responsive layout
- Test across different device sizes

#### 2. Dark Mode Toggle (0.5 day, 0 ACU)
- Create CSS variables for light/dark themes
- Implement theme toggle component
- Add theme persistence using localStorage

#### 3. Historical Data Visualization (1 day, 0 ACU)
- Integrate Chart.js or similar lightweight library
- Create basic price history chart component
- Implement time period selector (1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y)

#### 4. Save/Favorite Stocks Feature (0.5 day, 0 ACU)
- Implement localStorage-based favorites system
- Create favorites list component
- Add "Add to Favorites" button to stock analysis view

### Phase 2: Enhanced AI Analysis

#### 1. Improved Gemini Prompts Implementation (1 day, 5 ACU)
- Update GeminiAnalysisService with optimized prompts from PROMPTS.md
- Implement structured JSON response handling
- Add error handling and fallbacks

#### 2. Competitor Analysis Feature (1 day, 10 ACU)
- Create new endpoint in StockAnalysisController
- Implement competitor analysis service using Gemini
- Develop UI component to display competitor comparisons

#### 3. Basic Trend Analysis (1 day, 15 ACU)
- Implement trend analysis service using historical data
- Create endpoint for trend analysis
- Develop UI component to display trend insights

#### 4. Simple Predictive Indicators (1 day, 15 ACU)
- Implement basic predictive indicators (not full modeling)
- Focus on simple metrics like moving averages and momentum
- Create UI component to display predictive indicators

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Caching Responses**:
   - Cache Gemini API responses for common stocks
   - Implement TTL-based cache expiration (24 hours)
   - Estimated ACU savings: 30-40%

2. **Batched Processing**:
   - Combine multiple analysis requests into single Gemini calls
   - Pre-fetch data for popular stocks
   - Estimated ACU savings: 15-20%

3. **Prompt Optimization**:
   - Refine prompts to be more concise while maintaining quality
   - Use structured output formats to reduce token usage
   - Estimated ACU savings: 10-15%

## Future Expansion (Post-MVP)

After the initial MVP implementation, the following features could be added in future iterations:

1. **Advanced Predictive Modeling** (3 days, 30 ACU)
   - Implement more sophisticated prediction models
   - Add backtesting capabilities
   - Develop hypothesis refinement system

2. **Portfolio Analysis** (2 days, 20 ACU)
   - Allow users to create and analyze portfolios
   - Provide diversification recommendations
   - Calculate portfolio-level metrics

3. **News Integration** (1 day, 10 ACU)
   - Integrate relevant news articles
   - Implement sentiment analysis
   - Create news impact assessment

## Notes

1. **Developer Days**: Estimates assume a skilled full-stack developer familiar with Spring Boot and Angular.

2. **ACU Costs**:
   - Development and testing ACUs are included
   - Production usage would require additional ACUs based on actual usage
   - Implementing the suggested cost optimization strategies could reduce the total ACU cost by 20-30%

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Focus on frontend improvements first to enhance UX immediately
   - Implement AI features incrementally, starting with the highest value/lowest complexity
   - Use existing codebase patterns to minimize development time

4. **Technical Constraints**:
   - All features designed to work within the existing Java + Angular architecture
   - No additional infrastructure requirements beyond what's already in place
   - All data storage uses client-side storage (localStorage) to avoid backend database changes

This budget provides a realistic plan for implementing high-value improvements to Stock-Tok within the constraints of a 1-week timeframe and 30-50 ACU budget.
