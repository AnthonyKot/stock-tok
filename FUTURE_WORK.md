# Future Work for Stock-Tok

This document outlines features and enhancements that are planned for future iterations of Stock-Tok beyond the initial MVP implementation. These features require additional budget and development time but represent valuable enhancements to consider for subsequent releases.

## Advanced AI Analysis Features

### 1. Predictive Analysis (15 ACU)

The predictive analysis feature would provide forward-looking insights about stock performance:

```json
{
  "role": "financial_analyst",
  "task": "Predict future performance for {TICKER} based on historical data",
  "output_format": {
    "ticker": "{TICKER}",
    "shortTermOutlook": {
      "timeframe": "Next 12 months",
      "revenueGrowthPrediction": "<prediction with confidence level>",
      "marginTrendPrediction": "<prediction with confidence level>",
      "keyRisks": ["<risk 1>", "<risk 2>"]
    },
    "predictionConfidence": "<overall confidence assessment>",
    "keyAssumptions": ["<assumption 1>", "<assumption 2>"]
  }
}
```

Implementation would include:
- Predictive analysis service using Gemini
- Historical data integration for context
- UI components for displaying predictions
- Confidence level indicators

### 2. Investment Hypothesis Generation (10 ACU)

This feature would generate testable investment hypotheses:

```json
{
  "role": "financial_analyst",
  "task": "Generate investment hypotheses for {TICKER}",
  "output_format": {
    "ticker": "{TICKER}",
    "hypotheses": [
      {
        "statement": "<clear, testable hypothesis>",
        "rationale": "<economic or business logic>",
        "testingApproach": "<how to test using historical data>",
        "implicationsIfTrue": "<what this means for investors>"

## Budget and Timeline Estimates

| Feature Category | Estimated ACU Cost | Developer Days |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Advanced AI Analysis | 40-60 ACU | 10-15 days |
| Enhanced UX | 5-10 ACU | 8-12 days |
| Technical Enhancements | 0-5 ACU | 15-20 days |
